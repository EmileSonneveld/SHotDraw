/**
 * A very basic example for demonstraing JHotDraw's capabilities. It contains only
 * a few additional tools apart from the selection tool already provided by its superclass.
 * It uses only a single document interface (SDI) and not a multiple document interface (MDI)
 * because the applicateion frame is derived DrawApplication rather than MDI_DrawApplication.
 * To enable MDI for this application, NothingApp must inherit from MDI_DrawApplication
 * and be recompiled.
