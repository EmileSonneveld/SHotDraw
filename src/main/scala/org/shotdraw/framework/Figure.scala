/**
 * The interface of a graphical figure. A figure knows
 * its display box and can draw itself. A figure can be
 * composed of several figures. To interact and manipulate
 * with a figure it can provide Handles and Connectors.<p>
 * A figure has a set of handles to manipulate its shape or attributes.
 * A figure has one or more connectors that define how
 * to locate a connection point.<p>
 * Figures can have an open ended set of attributes.
 * An attribute is identified by a string.<p>
 * Default implementations for the Figure interface are provided
 * by AbstractFigure.<p>
 *
 * Figures can have <a name="dependent_figure">dependent figure</a>s. The existence od dependent
 * figures depend on another figure. This is the case for figures
 * such as ConnectedTextFigures and LineDecoration. Thus, they are
 * "externally" dependent on a figure in contrast to (internally)
 * contained figures. This means, "normal" figures (figures that
 * are not containers) can still have dependent figures. Dependent
 * figures are especially important if the figure which the depend
 * on is deleted because they should be removed as well (cascading delete).
