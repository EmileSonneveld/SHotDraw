/**
 * Figures to connect Connectors provided by Figures.
 * A ConnectionFigure knows its start and end Connector.
 * It uses the Connectors to locate its connection points.<p>
 * A ConnectionFigure can have multiple segments. It provides
 * operations to split and join segments.

 * <b><a href=../pattlets/sld034.htm>Strategy</a></b><br>
 * Strategy is used encapsulate the algorithm to locate the connection point.
 * ConnectionFigure is the Strategy context and Connector is the Strategy.<br>

 * <b><a href=../pattlets/sld026.htm>Observer</a></b><br>
 * Observer is used to track changes of the connected figures. A connection
 * figure registers itself as listeners or observers of the source and
 * target connector.
